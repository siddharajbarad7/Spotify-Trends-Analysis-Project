📈 Key Findings
🏆 Top Predictors of Popularity
Energy (22% importance) - Strongest correlation with popularity

Loudness (18% importance) - Direct impact on listener engagement

Danceability (15% importance) - Key factor for streaming success

Valence (12% importance) - Positive songs perform better

🎭 Genre Performance
Pop and Electronic genres show highest average popularity

Hiphop tracks have strongest explicit content correlation

Jazz and Classical have lower popularity but higher acousticness

⏱️ Optimal Song Characteristics
